Manuel will talk about his research into influencing mobile app design by tracking where users spend most of their time looking.  You can get more detail and background on this over at the [Base Blog](https://wearebase.com/about/blog/2016/eyes-on-affordable-gaze-detection-for-mobile-devices/){:target="_blank"}.
