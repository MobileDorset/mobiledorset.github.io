                <h3>What do you mean by talk?</h3>
                <p>A talk doesn’t necessarily have to be a presentation, it could merely be a discussion point or quick tip / lesson learnt.</p>
                <h3>What can I talk about?</h3>
                <p>Anything that happens in the lifecycle of Mobile Development. So design, development, testing, requirements. Anything newsworthy about the mobile sector you’d like to discuss.</p>
                <h3>How long can I talk for?</h3>
                <p>Anything from 30 seconds to 20 minutes, inc Q and A. This is to keep the talks short and punchy. If you have a larger topic you would like to discuss contact us at mobiledorset@gmail.com</p>
